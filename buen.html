			<h1>Buen Provecho</h1>
			<h2 class="sub">by Rachel Malley</h2>
		</div>
		<p>!Buen provecho! Quite like the French <em>bon appétit</em> this oft-used Spanish phrase basically means "May you enjoy this meal," or "May this meal be beneficial to you." During our three months living in Puerto Rico this summer, we heard these words used in every situation involving food: before eating a nice dinner with family, while slurping down passion fruit during a relaxing hammock session, from a waiter in a cafe, and even a random passerby on the street. Our curiosity about this practice only increased as each <em>buen provecho</em> was uttered. We began to see varying degrees of meaning in the expression, ranging from merely an instinctive pre-meal pleasantry, to a representation of Puerto Rican culture.</p>
				<p>These two words carry so much significance for us that it's difficult to do them justice in a single post. Posts beg brevity, but we could write a book about <em>buen provecho</em>. It's why we're here.</p>
			<p>But you aren't here to read a book. At least not yet. So instead we'll cull through our collective food bliss for the adventures, the tasty pics, the people who inspire us. We'll give you some words to chew on. So grab a fork, friends, and let me share a couple morsels.</p>
			<h2>Stranger Danger?</h2>
			<p>I had heard <em>buen provecho</em> used plenty of times when visiting family in Puerto Rico, but never gave it a second thought. It wasn't until I lived on the island that I started to pay attention.</p>
			<p>Jordan and I spent one hot July day in Old San Juan and found ourselves in a plaza-side cafe sipping coffees, chatting (most likely about Chewist) and eating egg breakfasts. Halfway through the meal, another diner walked by our table, smiled and offered a kind "buen provecho." I smiled, but was left feeling a little unsettled. What was this guy playing at? Was he a plainclothes waiter, part of an undercover operation to ensure that each customer is instructed to enjoy their meal?</p>

			<p>I grew up in Massachusetts, where there are only a handful of situations during which an exchange of words with a stranger is expected: <em>thank you</em> when someone holds a door; <em>sorry</em> when you invade someone's personal space, or, you know, breath too loudly; <em>please get off</em> when some fellow sits on your lap on the subway and then <em>kindly desist</em> when he proceeds to cough into your mouth. There is no such expectation when eating in public. For some reason, the idea of saying even one word to someone while they eat makes me feel all sweaty - surely they'll think I'm a stalker, or they'll want to engage in a long conversation that will be impossible to escape! But for many Puerto Ricans, saying <em>buen provecho</em> to any eater in the vicinity seems to come as readily to their lips as a fork does to mine. I'm sure they don't even think twice about saying it, it's just polite. And probably more prevalent around the world than I realize; is America the only country that doesn't have some form of this pleasantry?</p>
								<p>For most of my life I've operated under the assumption that avoiding interaction with unknown human beings is healthy social behavior. Fortunately a few months living in Puerto Rico cured me of that delusion. Each time I received a <em>buen provecho</em> from a stranger, it felt like a shared experience, a moment in which both of us acknowledged each other. It served as proof that speaking to strangers can in fact be quite a lovely experience (just don't sit on my lap unless invited.) It also lent credence to a notion that plays a big role in my passion for cooking: that the power of food to create an opportunity for connection is boundless.</p>
			<h2>A Taste of Silence</h2>
			<p>There is something magical about Puerto Rico. The people, the food, the beautiful land and oceans. We met one particular group of young women who exemplified the kind of vibrancy and passion that characterizes the island as a whole. These merry adventurers seem to be constantly exploring their island, discovering little known beaches and waterfalls, cleaning up rivers and lending a hand at a rural farm. On our last night at the farm we were care taking, they brought their smiles and good vibes over to join us for dinner.</p>
			<p>We all pitched in to create a meal for eight, giggling all the while and making grand plans for island excursions to go on together. When the food was done and we found ourselves gathered 'round a wicker foot stool that displayed a colorful array of food, each dish was described in detail by it's maker, while the rest of us listened with rapt attention. A couple of the women shared some words of gratitude for the food and the lovely circumstances under which we were all enjoying it.</p>
			<p>A very long moment of silence followed.</p>
			<p>No one else was in any rush to waste this precious occasion for quiet and calm. I - the I who quite routinely avoids the discomfort of stillness - was admittedly itching to dig into the feast. But I kept my squirming to a minimum and succeeded in enjoying the silence until it came to its natural conclusion. There was then a resounding <em>buen provecho!</em> that felt as if it were imbued with our collective appreciation for the food and the company.</p>

			<p>In sharp contrast with my usual tendency to begin eating as soon as my butt hits the chair (and sometimes sooner,) this shared moment of delayed gratification felt so novel. A refreshing apéritif of patience observed, it set the tone for the entire meal. I approached each bite with an attentiveness that I'd never quite experienced while eating before, taking note of the vegetables present in each dish, and the subtle flavors that would have otherwise escaped my hurried palate.</p>
			<p>It was during meals like this that I realized eating frantically and without pause is very American. Of course, fast food culture and the rapid inhalation of generically prepared product has invaded countries all over the world, including Puerto Rico. But after dining with these women, and observing the eating habits of many islanders, I'm happy to report that <em>buen provecho</em> prevails.</p>
			<h2>Remember</h2>
			<p>Slowing down and appreciating the simple and beautiful things in life is a big part of Puerto Rican culture. It is a philosophy that has strengthened my relationship with food and my overall experience of the world - I highly recommend it. As I transition to life back in the States, my hope is to carry this philosophy with me through the chaos of travel. It's easy to fall back into old routines of constantly looking ahead, instead of right in front of me; of eating without mindfulness. I want to wake each day with <em>buen provecho</em> on my lips, ready to move through my day with intention.</p>
				<p>So I say <em>buen provecho</em> to you. May all that we share on this blog be beneficial to you; may you enjoy the meals, the stories, the pictures; may we all chew slowly and deliberately. And occasionally encourage others to do the same. After all, everybody chews.</p>
