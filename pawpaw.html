				<h1>Me and the Paw Paws</h1>
			<h2 class="sub">by Jordan Diez</h2>
		</div>
		<p>Last week we got an email from a reader asking about the paw paw. </p>

		<blockquote>ever have a paw-paw before?</blockquote>

		<p>We just happened to be rolling into paw paw land: Virginia.</p>

		<p>Or paw paw land as I know it. The only place I've ever had one.</p>

		<p>And that is just what this is, the paw paw as <em>I</em> know it. I'm not hopping down any dark dank internet information holes to harvest some glistening nugget of wisdom. I'm writing what I know. And I'll be honest, it's not all that much. But it's worth sharing.</p>

		<h2>Time: 10 Years Ago<br>Location: Valencia, Spain</h2>

		<p>The first time I recall hearing about the paw paw was in a song on <em>The Fiery Furnaces'</em> epicly bizarre and occasionally brilliant album <em>The Blueberry Boat</em>. It's like <em>Where the Wild Things Are</em> by sea. In fact, I'm listening to it now. In <em>Paw Paw Tree</em>, Eleanor Friedberger sings:</p>

		<blockquote>Tied down with brown twine<br>
		Up past the tree line<br>
		Up by I hope where<br>
		The King of Spain don't care.<br>
		I'm sitting up in my paw paw tree<br>
		Wait they make mango mush outta me.</blockquote>

		<p>I wonder if there are paw paws in Spain. The paw paw trees I've seen in Virginia are a bit meek up against the other, taller, stronger looking trees. Hard to imagine anyone bigger than a child sitting up in one. Let alone past the tree line. Unless it was a forest of only paw paws. A little paw paw community. Do packs of trees have names like packs of lions do? Then let's call it a paw paw pride. Now <em>that</em> I can imagine. A paw paw pride would be a perfect place for a child to hide. Up "Where the King of Spain don't care."</p>
