		<p>Last week we got an email from a reader asking about the paw paw. </p>

		<blockquote>ever have a paw-paw before?</blockquote>

		<p>We just happened to be rolling into paw paw land: Virginia.</p>

		<p>Or paw paw land as I know it. The only place I've ever had one.</p>

		<p>And that is just what this is, the paw paw as <em>I</em> know it. I'm not hopping down any dark dank internet information holes to harvest some glistening nugget of wisdom. I'm writing what I know. And I'll be honest, it's not all that much. But it's worth sharing.</p>

		<h2>Time: 10 Years Ago<br>Location: Valencia, Spain</h2>

		<p>The first time I recall hearing about the paw paw was in a song on <em>The Fiery Furnaces'</em> epicly bizarre and occasionally brilliant album <em>The Blueberry Boat</em>. It's like <em>Where the Wild Things Are</em> by sea. In fact, I'm listening to it now. In <em>Paw Paw Tree</em>, Eleanor Friedberger sings:</p>

		<blockquote>Tied down with brown twine<br>
		Up past the tree line<br>
		Up by I hope where<br>
		The King of Spain don't care.<br>
		I'm sitting up in my paw paw tree<br>
		Wait they make mango mush outta me.</blockquote>

<p>I wonder if there are paw paws in Spain. The paw paw trees I've seen in Virginia are a bit meek up against the other, taller, stronger looking trees. Hard to imagine anyone bigger than a child sitting up in one. Let alone past the tree line. Unless it was a forest of only paw paws. A little paw paw community. </p>

<p>Do packs of trees have names like packs of lions do? </p>

<p>Let's call it a paw paw pride. Now <em>that</em> I can imagine. A paw paw pride would be a perfect place for a child to hide. Up "Where the King of Spain don't care."</p>

<p>The trees we found in mid-September that still had fruit were on the shadier parts of the hill. The rest of the trees must have peaked earlier. How early? I don't know, mid to late summer maybe. All I know is that they're abundant. The trees line many of the recreation trails in and around the city. They make your hikes especially delicious.</p>

<p>When Charlottesville was our home, we even had a couple of trees in our yard. That's when I had my first taste.</p>

<p>Ohhhh boy! Intensely sweet, delicate flesh. People like to throw the word <em>custard</em> around to describe the texture, but I don't know how I feel about that. An overripe paw paw can quickly turn into mango mush. Just like the song says. I prefer them just before that. See, the window of ripeness is short, which makes this something you'd never find in a traditional grocery store. I like that. It makes it special. That's how it should be.</p>

<p>When you get one at just the right time, the texture is a combination of nanner and mango, with a flavor profile that rep-re-sents!, as well as a bit of sour apple. It's pretty damn good.</p>

<p>The sour apple note is like a hit of freshly foraged greenyellow. [pic - inline block]</p>

<p>It makes your taste buds <a href="http://bit.ly/pawPop">pop and lock</a>.</p>

<p>[paw paw faces of food homage to video]</p>

<p>If that doesn't make you want to chew a paw paw I don't know what would.</p>

<p>Each fruit has several large black seeds. If you're eating it straight, no biggie - tear into it like the animal you know you are, and spit those buggers right out. If you want to process it for sorbet, smoothie, etc., getting that seed out could prove a bit tedious. But I say go for it! A paw paw sorbet would be ahh mazing. So give that paw paw your love.</p>

<p>But also your respect...</p>

<p>Cause when it's not ripe... #john?</p>

<p>One dreadful morning... it must have been Spring 2014. Our landlord was visiting. Tending to the orchard, doing some spring landscaping and maintenance. Maybe it was his over eager appetite, or maybe it was the captivating glowing greenyellow on the skin of a dew covered, early morning paw paw. </p>

<p>Whatever it was, he decided to pick them before their time. And not only that, but to turn them into some misshappen rendition of a biscuit. I think he may have used a grater on them, which gives you an idea of what their texture must have been like. 

<p>In Puerto Rican Spanish, grater is rallador, or ralla ralla<p>

<p>A roommate at the time, a good friend now, partook on one (or several... oh John?...) of those biscuits.</p>

<p>Soon after, he found himself sick with a painful and understandably upset tummy. </p>

<p>Hence, respect the paw paw.</p>

<p>But let's not end on such a sour note. </p>

<p>Let's end with another song! Yayyyy (kids screaming)!</p>

<p>After giving the Chew (&amp;) Digest community a nibble, a sneak peak of the Paw Paw, my inbox started to jingle. From what our devoted and knowledgable community says, there is an old folk song. I started to do some research on YouTube. Bad idea. Click on the creepy kids if you dare. </p>

<p>Does anyone know the old folk song? Let us know.</p>
