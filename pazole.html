			<h1>Pozole</h1>
			<h2 class="sub">by Rachel Malley</h2>
		</div>

		<p>For the first meal I cooked in our new temporary home in Pittsfield, I chose a dish that for me most elicits the feeling of family, comfort and home: pozole. My mom would make this on chilly autumn and winter nights, and it remains my all-time favorite soup. It's simple, easy to make, and most importantly, it's delicious. One of those dishes that feeds my body and soul, and evokes memories of the happy moments this soup has witnessed.</p>

<p>I remember slurping down pozole in the various places that I've considered home: around the kitchen table at my childhood house in Harvard; perched on the edge of the couch in my parents' Boston apartment on Sunday afternoons, reveling in the Patriots' total domination of their opponents; and while looking out at the lake in the ultimate comfort of their current home, The Cobble. This is the meal that reminds me of my very good fortune to find home in many places. I've always felt at home with my family and good friends, and in the past year have discovered it among strangers turned loved ones. And now, after a couple farm sits, some couchsurfing, and a little hitchhiking, we find ourselves in the loving home of an old friend, feeling full of gratitude, excitement, and pozole.</p>

		<div class="recipe">

			<h2>Pozole<span class="tiny"> serves 4-ish</span></h2>

		<p>1 lb pork tenderloin <br>
		2 TBSP southwest chipotle seasoning (I didn't have this, so I mixed some paprika, chipotle powder, cayenne pepper, and onion powder...you'll have to wing it with the measurements because I went freestyle on this!)<br>
		2 TBSP coconut oil<br>
		1/2 a large onion, diced (I used a little red and a little yellow, because that's what I found in the fridge.)<br>
		1 15.5 oz can of white hominy (Spanish lesson: pozole means "hominy")<br>
		3-4 medium tomatoes, diced<br>
		1 small jalapeno, minced<br>
		1 cup water<br>
		Cilantro<br>
		Greek yogurt or sour cream<br>
		Salt to taste</p>

		</div>

		<p>Cut pork into bite-sized pieces and toss them in a bowl with the chipotle seasoning until evenly coated. Heat up the coconut oil in a pot or deep pan and, when hot, throw in the pork and brown on all sides, for about 4 minutes. Add the diced onions, stir, and let cook for a couple more minutes. Add hominy with its juice, tomatoes, jalapeno and about a cup of water. You can add more water if you want it to be a bit soupier. Stir it a couple times, bring it to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and let it cook for 10-15 minutes, or until the pork is tender. This is a great time to fine tune the salt. When the flavors are bouncing and you just can't wait any longer, it's ready. Top with cilantro and greek yogurt...the yogurt is pretty essential, in my opinion. It cuts the heat and brings some creaminess into the mix.</p>

	<p><strong>Enjoy!</strong></p>
