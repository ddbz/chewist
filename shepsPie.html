<p>Last weekend I visited some very wonderful friends in Vermont, where the rolling hills are currently outlandishly beautiful. On our last day we went to an indoor, weekly farmer's market in Dorset, VT where everyone seemed to know each other. There's Betsy over at Tall Cat Coffee Roasters, who roasts her beans right in Dorset, and my goodness is that coffee smooth: http://www.tallcatcoffeeroasters.com/. And then there is Melissa at Pitchfork Preserves which makes delicious jams, jellies and pickles...I love everything I've tried there, particularly the Dilly Beans: http://www.pitchforkpreserves.com/. We tasted samples, chatted up the locals, even held some babies! Okay, it was only one baby, and I wasn't involved in the holding, but it was still fun. </p>

<p>I walked out of that place with a bag of locally roasted coffee, a bunch of vibrant rainbow chard, a pound of ground beef and a beautiful butternut squash. I always rationalize my farmers market purchases with the happy thought that at a farmer's market, everyone wins. I get access to vegetables that haven't been transported over oceans and half the country, and my money is going straight into the hands of the people who produced the food. It's a pretty fantastic feeling. </p>

<p>Like many of our traveling experiences, it was just another peek into a thriving community. Ahh community. Along with puppy dogs, a big garden, and steady income, we can't WAIT to have one of our own someday. It's always great to see the kind of people that our friends are surrounded by, especially because it gives us an idea of what kind of community we want to settle into. We have a lot to choose from, which is a great problem to have.</p>

<p>While brainstorming what to make with my newly acquired ingredients, my friend Brittany suggested one of her mother's go-to recipes: straight-up mashed butternut squash with butter. And thus a casserole was born: Butternut Squash Shepard's Pie. Enjoy!</p>

<div class="recipe">
<h2>Butternut Squash Shepard's Pie</h2>
<h3>Serves 4</h3>
 
<p>1 large butternut squash, peeled and cubed<br>
1 lb ground beef<br>
1 onion, diced (I used red, but white is fine too)<br>
4 cloves of garlic, minced<br>
2 TBSP butter <br>
Paprika<br>
Onion powder<br>
Cinnamon<br>
Salt and pepper to taste<br>
Bread crumbs to top, if so desired</p>

<p>Preheat the oven to 350°F. </p>

<p>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Peel and chop your butternut first. Last night a friend asked us if we had any tips on how to dice a butternut squash, and I just found this really useful video! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKIVhBYdxLE. Check it out if you are feeling intimidated by this step. Once diced, place the squash in the boiling water. After 15 minutes in the pot, poke the squash with a fork to test for tenderness. The fork should be able to poke without resistance. </p>

<p>While squash is boiling, heat up 1 tablespoon of butter in a pan and saute onions, stirring occasionally. After about 4-5 minutes, add the garlic and saute for a couple more minutes. Once the onions appear slightly translucent and the garlic smells delicious, add the ground beef, breaking it up with your stirring implement. Cook until meat turns brown. Now add your spices. I didn't take exact measurements of the spices because in my opinion it's hard to go wrong with this step. Try two shakes of onion powder, three shakes of paprika, and then take a little nibble to test. Add salt and pepper to really bring out all of the flavors. Once your beef mixture is in a good place, spoon it into an even layer on the bottom of a 9x13 baking dish. </p>

<p>When your squash is nice and soft, drain the water, keeping the squash in the pot. Mash your squash, then stir in the remaining tablespoon of butter, a couple shakes of cinnamon and salt and pepper to taste. Scoop the mashed squash on top of the ground beef, smoothing out the top. We mixed up some panko bread crumbs with Parmesan cheese and sprinkled it over the squash to add a bit of crunch to the dish, but that's not all too necessary. Another option is to finely chop some pecans or walnuts, brown them in a pan and sprinkle those on top. </p>

<p>Pop your casserole in the oven and let it cook for about 15 minutes! Let it sit for about 5 minutes. When serving, we topped our pieces with some creamy goat cheese, which I highly recommend. </p>
